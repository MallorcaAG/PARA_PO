- MainMenu background simulation of game. (Add last when we know everything works good)
- Add 5 sec Delay to LoadingScreen unactivating so player doesnt see stuff spawning 
- RespawnManager: "MissingReferenceException: The object of type 'VehicleAINavigator', Landmark.ClearArea ()"
	Also doesnt detect npcs that already spawned inside the landmark. Doesnt get assigned to the List. . .

		> Invincibility now at 5 seconds
	- Make counterflow checker cooldown more forgiving, atleast for the first few levels
