- MainMenu background simulation of game. (Add last when we know everything works good)
- Add 5 sec Delay to LoadingScreen unactivating so player doesnt see stuff spawning 
- RespawnManager: "MissingReferenceException: The object of type 'VehicleAINavigator', Landmark.ClearArea ()"
	Also doesnt detect npcs that already spawned inside the landmark. Doesnt get assigned to the List. . .

		> Idk how to lower the volume :( nothing works :( (feels like something is overriding it...)
	- Can we attach CameraPackage to Jeepney Prefab? And idk but I think we can dettach MainCamera from CameraPackage and it'll still work. . .
