	Bus Levels Bugs
	
	- vehicle spawners on roads are too many and spawn too much (try replacing with onstart spawner?)
	- adjust waypoint branching to reduce changing lanes too much
	- vehicles tend to change directions when hit and not vanish
	- opposite lane vehicles spawn in same direction as player and try to cross over to the other side (next waypoint issue? or spawner issue?)
	- continue button not working
