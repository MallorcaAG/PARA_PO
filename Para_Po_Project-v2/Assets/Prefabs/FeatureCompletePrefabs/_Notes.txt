	- Give 'Barrier' prefab appropriate barrier texture. Refer to GDD on what it should look like
	- Pedestrian Prefab has issues where 'The referenced script on this Behaviour (Game Object '<null>') is missing!'. I suspect this to be an issue on the timing of when the scripts run/execute?

	- Time Manager - fix day time skybox, it looks weird. Also night skybox doesn't kick in
	- Implement the raining feature and day/night cycle gameplay-wise
	- Vehicle Spawning - make it constant spawn as long as in Spawning Range
